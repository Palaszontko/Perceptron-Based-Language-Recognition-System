otocycle – one or two-track road vehicle with an own weight of up to 400 kg[1].

According to the Traffic Law, it is a vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, a two-wheeler or a side-car – multi-track. This term also includes a three-wheel vehicle with symmetrical wheel distribution[2].

Motorcycles were invented in the 19th century; then Louis G. Perraux constructed a steam-powered two-wheeler[3]. In 1885, in Germany, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach produced the first petrol-powered combustion motorcycle: Daimler Reitwagen. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series-produced motorcycle.

The design of the motorcycle is very diverse to suit many different purposes: long-distance travel, commutes, excursions, sports (including racing) and field riding. Worldwide, motorcycles are equally popular for cars as a means of transport. In 2021, around 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold worldwide[4], and 66.7 million cars were sold for comparison during the same period[5]. In 2014, the three world's leading motorcycle manufacturers were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan) and Hero MotoCorp (India)[6]. Of all motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and South-East Asia regions, excluding Japan, which focuses on cars. According to the United States Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per mile of vehicle driven was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars[7].
