Mineral water – natural healing water containing at least 1000 mg/dm3 dissolved solids[1] in the form of ions. In addition, it may contain dissolved gases of natural origin (carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide). Most often, it is the deep water that mineral salts obtained from the dissolution of minerals or rocks through which it flowed. For the first time, the definition of mineral water was defined at the Bad Nauheim International Balneological Congress in 1911[2].

In common language, mineral water is often used as a synonym for bottled water, which is wrong because not all water is bottled with mineral water.

The history of the use of mineral waters in Poland begins around 1800. Until 1992 only 28 mineral water sources were registered in Poland, whose quality was determined by high sanitary requirements. The mineral water was considered to be deep water, containing at least 1000 mg of life elements in 1 litre of water, and the elements contained in it formed appropriate quantitative relations. Following changes in 1992 and 1997, the quantitative threshold of elements was lowered, categorizing three types of water

According to the Food Safety and Nutrition Act, the concept of mineral water is no longer linked to the degree of mineralisation. Natural mineral water is ‘underground water mined with one or more natural or drilled holes, different from water intended for human consumption with primary chemical and microbiological purity and characteristic stable mineral composition and, in certain cases, physiological properties which have a beneficial effect on human health’[3].

In addition, the 2011 Law, in accordance with the European Parliament Directive, introduced the following classification of waters
