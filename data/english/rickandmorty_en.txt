Storyline
The show tells about the adventures of an eccentric, alcohol-dependent scientist Rick Sanchez, accompanied by his grandson Morty. Heroes travel in distant galaxies and alternate realities. In later episodes, they are also occasionally accompanied by Mortyâ€™s parents Beth and Jerry and his sister Summer. A mix of already unstable family life combined with the new ideas of a crazy father Beth has a production full of unusual black humour.
