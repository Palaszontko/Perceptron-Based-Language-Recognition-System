Flet – a wooden tube instrument from a group of lip aerophones. It is usually a thin, hollow tube in the middle (there are also flutes of other shapes, e.g. carmine).

The most famous varieties of flutes are the transversal flute (smaller – flute piccolo), the popular classical music instrument, and the simple flute, an instrument popular in artistic music until the 18th century, currently used to perform old music, contemporary music written for this instrument, in musical education classes in primary schools, and even to treat asthma[1].

By the 18th century, the name "flet" (flauto) meant straight flute, while the transverse flute was known as traverso.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, flute maintains its popularity in classical music. Especially with the discovery of medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music (which is used to make copies of simple and transverse flutes from the era) it becomes even more popular.

It is also, albeit to a limited extent, adapted as a jazz instrument. The first known jazz flute player was the Wayman Carver of Chick Webb's orchestra. Other famous jazz flute players include Tony Scott, Herbie Mann, Hubert Laws and Jerome Richardson.

Also in rock, especially in progressive, flute has become a popular and important instrument. In the permanent instrumental composition it is owned by groups and soloists such as Genesis (Peter Gabriel), Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson), Focus (Tijs Van Leer), Gryphon, Gong, Renaissance, Mike Oldfield and others.
