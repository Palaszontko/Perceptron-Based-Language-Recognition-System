Door â€“ moving partition (usually vertical), opening element in the building wall, furniture wall, bodywork of the vehicle along with the structure necessary to attach this element[3].

The doors used in the buildings shall close the openings for passage between the rooms. This type of door is found in many varieties, differing in shape, design and way of opening.

The moving element of the door is the wing, and the motionless frame of the opening is the frame. The handle used to open and close doors is a door handle. These elements are typical of traditional, most common doors. However, many modern solutions do not have a door handle or frame at all, and do not even have a typical wing, only door lobes. Doors can be remotely controlled by actuators, door machines, and can also automatically open when people approach. Due to the design, the doors are characterized by different levels of leak. For example, used in collective transport vehicles (bus, trolleybus, tram, etc.) doors placed inwards and folded are difficult to seal, whereas doors placed outwards and rear-slips are very tight, due to the separation of the movement of opening and pressing to the frame. It is also possible to make e.g. hinged doors in a sealed version, otherwise to construct a frame.

Door types due to the number of wings and the way they are fixed:

internal input (stairway);
external input (single-family house);
hinges (right or left);
single-wing;
two-winged;
shuttles;
rotary;
sliding;
folding;
harmonics;
put outside (using forks on which the lobes are suspended);
placed inwards (with forks on which the lobes are suspended);
rebound-slip;
Rolled;
It's tilted.
